# TicTacToeStrategy

**TicTacToeStrategy** is an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that includes real-time statistical insights into potential game outcomes. These insights are based on precomputed data about all possible endgame scenarios, generated using the Python script [`extractStats.py`](https://github.com/adebiasi/TicTacToeStrategy/blob/main/extractStats.py). The resulting file, [`actions.json`](https://github.com/adebiasi/TicTacToeStrategy/blob/main/actions.json), is parsed in a [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) application to visualize strategic statistics during gameplay.

### Game Assumptions

The game displays outcome probabilities (win/tie) based on different assumptions about your opponent's strategy:

- **No assumptions** â€“ The opponent makes completely random moves.
- **Win-seeking opponent** â€“ The opponent always chooses the move that leads to the highest chance of winning.
- **Win or tie-seeking opponent** â€“ The opponent tries to avoid losing, aiming for a win or at least a tie.
